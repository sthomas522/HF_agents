She died from multiple organ failure on 4 October 2009, at 5:15 am. She is survived by one son, Fabián Matus, born of her first marriage. He said: \"She lived her 74 years to the fullest. She had done practically everything she wanted, she didn\\'t have any type of barrier or any type of fear that limited her\". The hospital expressed its sympathies to her relatives. Her website featured the following: \"Her undisputed talent, her honesty and her profound convictions leave a great legacy to future generations\".\\nHer body was placed on display at the National Congress building in Buenos Aires for the public to pay their respects, and President Fernández de Kirchner ordered three days of national mourning. Thousands had queued by the end of the day.'),\n",
